## Summary
Dr. Stefan Aigner is an RNA biochemist, neuroscientist and stem cell biologist.  He received his pre-diploma in biochemistry from the University of Regensburg (Germany) in 1995.  Funded by a fellowship from the German Academic Exchange Service, Dr. Aigner spent a year as an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he also joined the chemistry and biochemistry graduate program in 1997 and received his Ph.D. in 2003.  In his doctoral thesis work with Dr. Thomas Cech, he elucidated the role of p43, a protein subunit of telomerase from the ciliated model organism, Euplotes.  He showed that despite extensive homology to the ubiquitous La autoantigen, p43 is a telomerase-specific protein with dedicated roles in telomerase ribonucleoprotein maturation and enzymatic function.  As a postdoctoral fellow of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, Dr. Aigner joined the laboratory of Dr. Fred Gage in 2005, where he studied transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation in embryonic and adult neurogenesis.  In 2011, Dr. Aigner accepted a position in Neuroscience Discovery at F. Hoffmann - La Roche in Basel (Switzerland) and established pluripotent stem-cell based models of autism and associated high-throughput drug screening assays.  Since June 2014, Dr. Aigner has been an Associate Project Scientist in the Yeo lab.  Here, his focus is on developing tools for transcriptome-wide identification of RNA structure and sites of RNA binding protein interaction.  He also continues to build scalable technologies for cellular modeling of neurological disorders.
