## Summary
In 2008, Melissa received her B.S./M.S. in Bioinformatics from the Rochester Institute of Technology through their dual-degree five-year program.  While earning these degrees she also held co-op positions at Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Diffinity Genomics. At Roswell, she aided in the design of array CGH platforms targeting regions involved in insertion and deletion syndromes and management of their microarray data.  Her project at Diffinity Genomics, operating out of the University of Rochester, was design of a quantitative test for genomic DNA using a gold nanoparticle solution.  For her Masters thesis, she analyzed newly sequenced influenza A genomes isolated from humans to gain insight into the functional adaptation of the virus to various climates, its global spread, and seasonality. Currently, Melissa is a graduate student in the Biomedical Sciences program at UCSD.  She is studying the deletion and misregulation of RNA binding proteins in Autism spectrum disorders, using human pluripotent cells as a tool. Melissa is funded through a Genentech fellowship and is also a member of the genetics training program.
