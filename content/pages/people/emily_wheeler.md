B.S. Environmental Science, Indiana University 2014<br>

## Summary

Emily is a PhD student in the Biomedical Science Department at UCSD and a member of the Genetics Training Program. She graduated from Indiana University with a BS in environmental science in 2014 with highest honors distinction from the Hutton Honors College. She completed her undergraduate thesis work in Dr. Heather Hundley’s lab studying RNA editing by ADARs. This was done using high throughput sequencing techniques to detect and understand how editing sites were selected in the C. elegans model system. Before joining Heather’s lab, Emily spent two years working under Dr. Rich Phillips and Dr. Danilo Dragoni studying forest ecology and quantifying carbon storages in temperate deciduous forests.

Emily is now working in collaboration with Dr. Rafael Bejar to understand the role of splicing factor mutations that commonly occur in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Although her background is in wet lab, molecular biology, Emily is also learning computational methods to study how these mutations affect the RNA landscape in patients. In her free time, Emily loves to be outdoors enjoying the beautiful San Diego weather. She enjoys running, soccer, swimming, hiking, camping, and in the winter making her way north to the mountains for downhill skiing.
