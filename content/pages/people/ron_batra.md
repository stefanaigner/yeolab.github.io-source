## Summary

Ron is a postdoctoral scholar at Gene Yeo lab at the University of California, San Diego and funded by the myotonic dystrophy foundation (MDF). Ron finished his Bachelors degree in Pharmacy at the University of Delhi at New Delhi, India. During his undergraduate, Ron worked on drug-receptor interactions and biopharmaceutics. Subsequently, Ron joined the masters program in pharmacology at the Ohio State University at Columbus, Ohio where he was a part of Jeff Kuret lab used transmission electron microscopy to study the kinetics of aggregation of the Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia related protein Tau (MAPT). Ron completed his PhD in genetics at Maurice Swanson’s lab at the University of Florida and elucidated the role of muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins in alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) in cellular models, mouse models, and patient tissues of myotonic dystrophy patients. Ron spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, FL where he studied RNA processing defects in sporadic and C9orf72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis human autopsy samples. Ron joined Yeo lab in 2015 and is interested in studying the role of RNA-binding proteins and RNA processing in neurological disorders. Ron wants to use novel cutting-edge technologies such as single cell systems, and high-throughput genomics/proteomics to study pathological mechanisms of diseases such as myotonic dystrophy and ALS. In his free time, Ron likes to indulge in fitness training, hiking, and exploring/cooking food.
