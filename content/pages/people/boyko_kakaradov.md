## Summary

Boyko is a Ph.D. student in the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology program at University of California, San Diego.  His research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and molecular biology. Boyko's scientific career started in Prof. Daphne Koller's group at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab where he helped create HACO, a clustering algorithm which integrates multiple sources of noisy experimental data to exactly reconstruct protein complexes and their interactions.  Since this debut, he has been involved in several other projects:
* an automated microscopy system for tracking and lineage reconstruction of pluripotent stem cells developed with Professors Sebastian Thrun and Helen Blau at Stanford University
* Hammer, a tool for error correction of high-throughput sequencing datasets developed by Paul Medvedev and Prof. Pavel Pevzner at UC San Diego
RobustPSI, an investigation into the challenges of estimating percent inclusion for alternatively spliced junctions from RNA-seq data conducted with Prof. Brendan Frey at the University of Toronto
