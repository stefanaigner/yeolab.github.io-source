## Summary

Michael Lovci is a graduate student in the Biomedical Sciences program at UCSD.  He received his undergraduate degree in General Biology in 2009 from UCSD. During his time as an undergraduate he was actively involved in several projects related to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data, including RNAseq data as well as CLIP-seq data.  Currently a second-year graduate student, he has developed several tools for these type of large-scale analyses.  He is currently working to elucidate the role of several RNA-binding proteins and their contribution to human neurological and cardiovascular disease.
