## Summary

Tomas Bos received his PhD in Medical Sciences from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium in 2010. Dr. Bos investigated during his PhD novel ways to deliver lentiviral vectors more efficiently to cancer cells. Another focus during his PhD was the explodingfield of epigenetics. He identified novel epigenetic layers in the regulation of the pro-apoptotic Bim protein in Multiple Myeloma. More specific, he showed that the IGF1 growth factor is directly involved in modifying the epigenetic signature of both the Bim and the FoxO3A promoter. His wide interest in science resulted in publications in very diverse fields ranging from diabetes to in vivo small animal imaging and in the Emmanuel Vander Schueren Award. Before joining the Yeo lab, he stayed a fewmonths at the Salk Institute in the department of Regulatory Biology to study the role of CTCF in breast cancer. Dr. Bos is now studying the role of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. Other projects he is involved in are the use of genomic engineering tools (TALEN and CRIPR/CAS) to engineer recombinant cell lines, the ENCODE project studying the sequence specificity of RBPs in RNA and the family of ADAR proteins Dr. Bos is funded by the Belgian American Education Foundation (BAEF) and is a Hoover Foundation Brussels Fellow.
